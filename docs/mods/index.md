## Standalone mods

### [ReworkedNetherite](../mods/reworked-netherite/index.md)

ReworkedNetherite currently is a vanilla style upgrade on netherite. The mod adds more nether(ite) themed features such as a liquid or a bow. Currently, the mod doesn't provide very many features however, it does provide netherite ore generation like any other ore in existence. The mod may not be that useful on itself, however, in modpacks where there is so many netherite required, this may be a very handy mod to have in a modpack. In the future, I plan on turning this mod into a netherite themed tech mod. How or when, I don't know yet.
## Library and API

### [More Outputs API](../mods/more-outputs-api/index.md)
What is this mod? This mod is a small, but powerful library allowing developers to add recipes containing more than one output as vanilla source does not provide a way to do that.
It consists of 3 classes, allowing for 2, 3 or 4 outputs. I might add more, but at some point it isnt worth it to add more.

To DO | When | Active Development
------------ | ----------------- |
Make it one class that allows all possible amounts of outputs | Some time | No

DISCLAIMER: I have only tested [Kaupenjoe's](https://youtube.com/Tutorials-By-Kaupenjoe) way of registering custom Recipes.
Other ways might work, but not ones I know of. I kindly ask to report other ways, bugs or issues to the github repository. Please use the correct lable depending on your report.
