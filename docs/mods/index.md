## Library and API

### [More Outputs API](../mods/more-outputs-api/index.md)
What is this mod? This mod is a small, but powerful library allowing developers to add recipes containing more than one output as vanilla source does not provide a way to do that.
It consists of 3 classes, allowing for 2, 3 or 4 outputs. I might add more, but at some point it isnt worth it to add more.

To DO | When | Active Development
------------ | ----------------- |
Make it one class that allows all possible amounts of outputs | Some time | No

DISCLAIMER: I have only tested [Kaupenjoe's](https://youtube.com/Tutorials-By-Kaupenjoe) way of registering custom Recipes.
Other ways might work, but not ones I know of. I kindly ask to report other ways, bugs or issues to the github repository. Please use the correct lable depending on your report.
