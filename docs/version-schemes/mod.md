## Version schemes for the mods

Note: it isnt worth backporting to version prior to 1.18 and certainly not prior to 1.14 so those versions won't be backported.
All my mods follow this general version scheme. If it is different for some mod, it will be listed at their page.

Minecraft Version | Mod Version | Mod Loader
------------ | ------------- | ----------
< 1.18 | -  | -
1.18.x | 0.2.x  | Fabric as default
1.19.x | 0.5.x | Fabric as default
1.20.x | 1.x.x | Fabric as default
1.21.x | 2.x.x | Fabric as default
