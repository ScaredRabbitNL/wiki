# Welcome to ScaredRabbits' wiki

This is the place you will find all wikis for every mod or plugin I have made. With this, I am aiming to provide the best wiki I possibly can for you to understand.
Even if the mod / plugin is small, it will be documented anyways.

## Why?
Have you ever used a mod (or plugin) that you didn't know how to use? Well, I have and I can tell you that it is really annoying to get started on something when you don't know how to start. That is why I want a as clear as possible to provide the best user experience I can. However, that also comes with a downside and that downside is that it takes a lot of time to develop the content and develop the documentation itself. After all, this is still a hobby and I also have other things to do so in some periods, so updates might come out very slowly because of that but also because I am the only one working on the project(s). Hope you understand 😊.
